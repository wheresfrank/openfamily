# Privacy

Whereabouts is a self-hosted family location tracker. This document describes
what the software stores and who can see it. The operator of each deployment
is the data controller for that instance.

## What is stored

- **Accounts:** email, display name, optional phone number, password hash
  (Argon2id), optional avatar bytes.
- **Family membership and roles:** admin, member, or child.
- **Devices:** platform, name, push endpoint, last seen.
- **Live and historical location:** coordinates, time, accuracy, battery,
  motion. History is kept for **90 days** (TimescaleDB retention). The last
  known point per person (`member_positions`) is kept until the account is
  deleted so inactive members still appear on the map.
- **Places and geofences:** names, points, radii, arrive/leave flags.
- **Safety alerts:** SOS / Help / Check-in notes and short-lived share tokens
  (24 hours).
- **Emergency contacts:** name and phone (for optional SMS).
- **Audit log:** auth and admin actions. Location ingest logs a device id, not
  raw coordinates (once that backend change is deployed).

There is **no analytics SDK**, crash reporter, or vendor location pipeline in
the app.

## Who can see location

- Members of the same family (including the child role, who can view the map
  but cannot edit places).
- The platform admin of that server (`/admin`), if one is configured.
- Emergency contacts, only when SOS fires and optional Twilio SMS is enabled.
  The SMS carries a 24-hour share URL on *your* server when `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
  is HTTPS; otherwise it may fall back to lat/lon.

## What leaves your server

- **Map tiles:** by default the phone loads public OpenStreetMap (street) and
  Esri (satellite) images. Those hosts see the map viewport (roughly where you
  are looking). Set `TILE_URL` / `SATELLITE_TILE_URL` on the server to use
  another provider or your own tiles. A key in that URL is visible to every
  phone and to anyone who can call `GET /config`.
- **Android push:** your ntfy server (or another UnifiedPush distributor).
  Payloads omit the tracked person's name unless `VERBOSE_PUSH=true`.
- **iOS push:** APNs (platform requirement). Payloads do not include
  coordinates.
- **Optional SMS:** Twilio sees destination numbers and the share URL.

## Your controls

- **Location sharing** toggle: this device stops reporting.
- **Change or delete account** in the Android app (delete is blocked if you
  are the last admin of a family that still has other people).
- **Biometric unlock** covers the UI; it does not encrypt background
  credentials used to report location.

## Operator duties

Encrypt the disk (or Postgres) at rest, keep backups private, set
`APP_ENV=production`, and close open registration with `PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAIL`.
